I built a simple Flask API that helps clean and analyze CSV data. It has three endpoints: one removes duplicates and fixes data types, another gives you summary statistics like mean and max values, and the third calculates correlations between numeric columns. I used Flask for the web framework, Pandas for data processing, and wrote pytest tests to make sure everything works correctly.
